# HANGTHEMAN

HANGTHEMAN is an iteration of the so classical game of Hangman where the aim is to guess the word in it's whole or guessing letters one by one before you get hung, which in this case means 6 tries before you lose. 

To start playing the user guesses a letter or if they feel extra cocky they can always guess the word directly. Validation messages to point out when the user is doing an incorrect input is also available. 

It's fun and will prove to be a challenge, don't step away from it.
