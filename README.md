# HANGTHEMAN

HANGTHEMAN is an iteration of the so classical game of Hangman where the aim is to guess the word in it's whole or guessing letters one by one before you get hung, which in this case means 6 tries before you lose. 

To start playing the user guesses a letter or if they feel extra cocky they can always guess the word directly. Validation messages to point out when the user is doing an incorrect input is also available. 

It's fun and will prove to be a challenge, don't step away from it.

## How to Play

The computer decides on a word that you then have to guess letter by letter or if possible the word in it's entirety straight away.
If you fail to do so you will lose and be hung while safety is in guessing the correct word. 

## User Experience (UX)

A very simple but oh so enjoyable game that is easy to get the hang of and spend time on. 
It's not more than blank spaces correlating with the amount of letters you should guess to win.
